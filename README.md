This repository contains a CUDA implementation of a deep residual CNN. The code is a part of a PhD research project at Imperial College London titled "Investigating the Behavior of Deep Convolutional Networks in Image Recognition". At the final stage this repository will contain the standard network implementation, and other variations that we implemented during the research project. These variations include an implementation that can be trained using a variable input size, an implementation that uses data hierarchy by incorporating category labels, and a multitasking network that can be trained on multiple datasets.


Currently, 7 January 2019, we uploaded the standard implementation where the main cuda program is named mainProgram_StandardDCN.cu, and the main cuda kernels are put in the cuda file cudaKernels.cu. All other functions are put in the Functions.cpp file. Most of the network training and inference settings are put in the ConstantSettings.h file and can easily be changed form there. Hopefully we will upload all the other implementations shortly. All implementations use similar cuda kernels with few changes, and similar function with few noticeable additions. Therefore, we will update the  cudaKernels.cu and  Functions.cpp files to accommodate all implementations, and therefore we will only add one or two files per implementation, mainly the mainProgarm_implementaion.cu.
